# BenchBox Test Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the BenchBox library, a hermetic library designed to embed benchmark datasets and queries for database evaluation. The strategy follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and aims to ensure high quality, reliability, and performance of the library across different database systems.

## Testing Objectives

1. Validate that the library meets all functional requirements
2. Ensure cross-database compatibility and consistent behavior
3. Verify performance characteristics for data generation and query execution
4. Confirm extensibility for custom benchmarks and database systems
5. Ensure code quality, maintainability, and documentation

## Test Levels

### Unit Testing

**Scope**: Individual classes, methods, and functions
**Focus**: Core functionality, edge cases, error handling
**Tools**: pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-mock
**Coverage Target**: ≥ 90% line coverage

#### Key Unit Testing Areas:
- Abstract base classes and interfaces (using mock implementations)
- Data generation components
- Query handling and translation
- SQL dialect transformation using sqlglot
- Utility functions and helpers

### Integration Testing

**Scope**: Interaction between components
**Focus**: Component interaction, workflow validation
**Tools**: pytest with fixtures, docker-compose for database instances
**Coverage**: All component interaction paths

#### Key Integration Testing Areas:
- Benchmark initialization and setup
- Data generation pipeline
- Query execution workflow
- Cross-component data flow
- Configuration management

### System Testing

**Scope**: End-to-end functionality of the library
**Focus**: Real-world usage scenarios
**Tools**: pytest, docker containers for database systems
**Coverage**: All supported benchmarks and databases

#### Key System Testing Areas:
- Complete benchmark executions
- Cross-database query execution
- Performance measurements
- Resource utilization
- Realistic data volumes (scaled-down)

### Performance Testing

**Scope**: Performance characteristics of critical operations
**Focus**: Execution time, memory usage, scalability
**Tools**: pytest-benchmark, memory-profiler
**Coverage**: Data generation, query execution, SQL translation

#### Performance Testing Areas:
- Data generation speed with various scale factors
- Query execution time across database systems
- Memory consumption for large datasets
- Scaling characteristics

## Testing Approaches

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

1. **Write Tests First**: All features begin with test specification
2. **Implement Features**: Develop minimal code to pass tests
3. **Refactor**: Improve implementation while maintaining test compliance
4. **Iterate**: Expand tests and features incrementally

### Mock Testing

- Use pytest-mock for creating mock objects
- Create test doubles for database connections
- Simulate various database responses and errors
- Mock file systems and external resources

### Parametrized Testing

- Test with multiple database dialects
- Test with various data scale factors
- Test with different configuration settings
- Test with multiple query variations

### Property-Based Testing

- Use hypothesis for property-based testing
- Test data generation with various constraints
- Verify SQL translations across dialects
- Confirm invariants in query result processing

## Test Environments

### Local Development Environment

- pytest for running tests
- Pre-commit hooks for running tests before commits
- Containerized databases for integration testing

### Continuous Integration Environment

- Automated test execution on every pull request
- Matrix testing across Python versions (3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13)
- Coverage reporting and enforcement
- Performance regression detection

## Test Data Management

- Small, fixed test datasets for unit tests
- Generated test data for integration tests
- Standard benchmark data at minimum scale factors
- Cross-database test data consistency validation

## Test Organization

### Directory Structure

```
tests/
├── unit/               # Unit tests for individual components
│   ├── core/           # Tests for core components
│   ├── benchmarks/     # Tests for specific benchmarks
│   ├── data_gen/       # Tests for data generation
│   └── query/          # Tests for query management
├── integration/        # Tests for component interactions
├── system/             # End-to-end tests
├── performance/        # Performance benchmarks
└── conftest.py         # Common test fixtures and utilities
```

### Naming Conventions

- Test files: `test_<module_name>.py`
- Test classes: `Test<ClassName>`
- Test methods: `test_<functionality>_<scenario>`
- Fixtures: `<resource_type>_<characteristics>`

## Test Monitoring and Reporting

- Test coverage reports using pytest-cov
- Performance benchmark history
- Test execution time tracking
- Failure analysis and categorization

## Continuous Testing Workflow

1. **Pre-commit Testing**: Run unit tests and linting
2. **Pull Request Testing**: Run full test suite including integration tests
3. **Nightly Testing**: Run complete system and performance tests
4. **Release Testing**: Comprehensive testing across all supported configurations

## Defect Management

- All identified issues must have a corresponding test case
- Regression tests must be created for every fixed bug
- Test failure triage process with priority classification
- Non-deterministic test identification and handling

## Test Documentation

- Each test file must include a docstring explaining its purpose
- Complex test scenarios must be documented with comments
- Test fixtures must be documented with their purpose and usage
- Test data generation must be documented for reproducibility

## Response to Test Results

- Failed tests block merging of pull requests
- Performance regressions trigger alerts
- Coverage decreases require justification
- Test flakiness triggers investigation

## Version-Specific Testing Considerations

- Testing against multiple versions of key dependencies
- Database-specific test adaptations
- Operating system-specific considerations
- Python version compatibility testing

This test strategy is a living document and will be updated as the project evolves and new testing needs are identified.
