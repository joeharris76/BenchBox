"""Comprehensive End-to-End Integration Tests for TPC-DI ETL Workflow.

This module provides comprehensive integration tests that validate the complete
TPC-DI ETL workflow from source data generation through query execution and validation.

The tests cover:
- Complete workflow: source data generation → ETL pipeline → query execution → validation
- Real database testing (DuckDB)
- All three batch types with realistic data scenarios
- Query dependency resolution after ETL completion
- Data quality validation and reporting
- Performance with larger scale factors
- Concurrent batch processing
- Error recovery and rollback scenarios
- Realistic TPC-DI data volumes and patterns
- Timing and performance assertions

These tests demonstrate that the complete TPC-DI ETL implementation works correctly
and meets performance expectations for real-world data integration scenarios.
