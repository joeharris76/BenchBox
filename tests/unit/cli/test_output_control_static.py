"""Static guardrails for centralized runtime output control.

Design: ratchet pattern
-----------------------
* The global scan covers every .py file under benchbox/ automatically —
  no manual per-file lists to forget to update.
* _PRINT_ALLOWLIST: files that legitimately construct or use print() directly
  (only the output implementation itself).
* _PENDING_MIGRATION: files with pre-existing print() usage that have not yet
  been migrated to emit().  This set must only ever SHRINK.  A companion test
  enforces that: if you migrate a file, you must remove it from this set or
  the test suite fails.
* New files are covered automatically.  Any new file with raw print() that
  is not in _PENDING_MIGRATION causes an immediate test failure.
