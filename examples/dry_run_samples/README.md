# Dry Run Sample Artifacts

These curated outputs show the shape of the JSON/YAML previews generated by
`--dry-run OUTPUT_DIR`.

- `duckdb_tpch_power.*` — produced from the local DuckDB TPC-H power script.
  The JSON snippet includes the first few queries and indicates how the
  per-query SQL files are organised.
- `databricks_tpch_power.*` — illustrative output for the Databricks example
  highlighting platform configuration and resource estimates. In a real run the
  script writes timestamped artifacts with the complete query list and schema
  preview.

Run any example with `--dry-run` to create fresh previews; the artifacts will
include timestamped filenames alongside detailed console summaries.
