- Use query cost estimates before execution
- Consider BigQuery slots for predictable pricing

### Snowflake
- Credit-based pricing model
- Warehouse size affects cost and performance
- Automatic suspend/resume helps control costs

### Redshift
- Node-based pricing (hourly)
- Reserved instances offer significant discounts
- Pause clusters when not in use

### ClickHouse
- Self-managed: infrastructure costs only
- Cloud providers: various pricing models
- Generally most cost-effective for high-volume analytics

## How to Use These Notebooks

### For First-Time Users
1. **Start with Quick Start**: Each notebook has a 4-7 cell Quick Start section that runs a complete benchmark in 3-5 minutes
2. **Follow the Flow**: Notebooks are designed to be executed sequentially from top to bottom
3. **Read the Comments**: Every cell has detailed explanations of what it does and why
4. **Check Prerequisites**: Each notebook lists required environment variables and credentials at the top

### For Advanced Users
1. **Jump to Advanced Examples**: Section 3 has 10 examples of complex scenarios
2. **Customize Configurations**: All platform-specific tuning options are documented
3. **Use Diagnostic Tools**: Section 6 has working functions to debug any issues
4. **Compare Results**: Built-in comparison tools to track improvements over time

### For Production Use
1. **Adapt Authentication**: Multiple auth methods shown - choose what fits your security model
2. **Schedule Runs**: All benchmarks can be automated via notebook scheduling (Databricks, Airflow, etc.)
3. **Export Results**: Built-in exporters to JSON, CSV, and HTML for reporting
4. **Monitor Costs**: Every notebook includes cost tracking and estimation

## Best Practices

### Setup & Security
1. **Secure Credentials**: Use environment variables or secrets managers - never hardcode credentials
2. **Test Authentication First**: Run the connection test cell before starting benchmarks
3. **Start with Small Scale**: Begin with SF 0.01 (10MB) to verify setup before scaling up
4. **Review Permissions**: Use the permission validation cells to ensure proper access

### Running Benchmarks
5. **Monitor Costs**: Check cost estimation cells before running large-scale benchmarks
6. **Use Appropriate Scale**: SF 0.01 for testing, SF 0.1-1.0 for realistic workloads, SF 10+ for production-scale testing
7. **Save Baselines**: Export your first run as baseline for regression detection
8. **Clean Up Resources**: Drop test databases and pause/stop clusters when done

### Analysis & Optimization
9. **Review All Visualizations**: 6+ charts reveal different performance insights
10. **Check Platform Metrics**: Use native monitoring tools (Spark UI, INFORMATION_SCHEMA, ACCOUNT_USAGE, STL tables) alongside BenchBox results
11. **Compare Configurations**: Run multiple configurations (different cluster sizes, tuning options) to find optimal setup
12. **Document Findings**: Export results and add notes about what worked for your use case
