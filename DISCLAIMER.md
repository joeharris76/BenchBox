### What Alpha Status Means for BenchBox

As alpha software, BenchBox is **actively developed and experimental**. Here's what you should expect:

**API Stability**: APIs, method signatures, and configuration formats may change between versions without deprecation warnings. We recommend pinning to specific versions in production environments.

**Feature Completeness**: While core functionality works, some features may be incomplete, experimental, or have known limitations. Check our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/joeharris76/benchbox/issues) for current known issues.

**Support & Response Times**: Support is provided on a best-effort basis through GitHub issues. Response times may vary, and immediate fixes for non-critical issues cannot be guaranteed.

**Production Usage**: We recommend thorough testing before using BenchBox in production environments. Consider using stable scale factors and well-tested benchmarks initially.

### What Works Well

- **Core TPC-H and TPC-DS benchmarks** with DuckDB, DataFusion, and major cloud platforms
- **Data generation** at various scale factors
- **Query execution** with basic performance measurement
- **Platform adapters** for DuckDB, DataFusion, SQLite, Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, ClickHouse

### What's Experimental

- **Advanced platform-specific optimizations** and tuning configurations
- **Result analysis and comparison tools**
- **Custom benchmark creation** and extension APIs
