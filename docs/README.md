# BenchBox Documentation

```{tags} beginner
```

BenchBox helps you run industry benchmarks across analytical databases. The documentation is organized to get you productive quickly and keep deeper references tidy.

## Start Here

- [Getting started in 5 minutes](usage/getting-started.md) — install, run your first benchmark, and inspect the output.
- [CLI quick reference](usage/cli-quick-start.md) — command overview and the most useful flags.
- [Choose a platform](platforms/platform-selection-guide.md) — requirements and trade-offs for each adapter.
- [Installation & environment setup](usage/installation.md) — uv, pip, extras, and dependency checks.

## Versioning & Releases

BenchBox adopts Semantic Versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) to communicate compatibility expectations:

- Increase **MAJOR** for breaking CLI, configuration, or API changes.
- Increase **MINOR** for backward-compatible feature additions.
- Increase **PATCH** for bug fixes or documentation-only updates.

Current release: `v0.1.0`. Use `benchbox --version` for a human-readable summary or `benchbox --version-json` when you need structured diagnostics in automation. Both commands confirm that the package, `pyproject.toml`, and documentation markers stay aligned. Platform runs now capture the requested versus resolved driver package versions, so comparisons across DuckDB or connector releases remain reproducible.
