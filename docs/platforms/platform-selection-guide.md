# Platform Selection Guide

```{tags} beginner, guide, sql-platform
```

This guide helps you choose the optimal database platform for your BenchBox benchmarking needs based on your specific requirements, constraints, and objectives. Start by running `uv run benchbox check-deps --matrix` to see which optional connectors are installed locally, then use `benchbox platforms install <name>` and `benchbox platforms enable <name>` to activate the adapters that match your shortlist.

> Curious about what's being evaluated next? Check the [Development Roadmap](../development/roadmap.md) for planned platform and benchmark additions.

benchbox run --platform pandas-df --benchmark tpch --scale 0.1
```

## Platform Extras and Installation Matrix

BenchBox uses optional dependency extras to keep the core installation lightweight. Install just the connectors you need, or combine extras for broader coverage. Always wrap the extras specification in quotes when using shells like zsh.

| Extra              | What it Enables                                           | Install Command                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `(none)`           | DuckDB + SQLite (local development)                       | `uv add benchbox`                         |
| `[cloudstorage]`   | Cloudpathlib helpers for S3, GCS, Azure paths             | `uv add benchbox --extra cloudstorage`        |

## Presto Lineage: Trino vs PrestoDB vs Athena

- **Trino**: Community-driven fork; uses `trino` Python client and `X-Trino-*` headers. Compatible with Starburst deployments.
- **PrestoDB**: Original project maintained by Meta; uses `presto-python-client` with `X-Presto-*` headers. Compatible with Meta ecosystem tools.
- **Athena**: AWS managed service built on the Presto/Trino lineage; serverless execution without self-managed coordinators.

## SQL vs DataFrame: When to Choose Each

Before diving into platform specifics, consider whether SQL or DataFrame APIs better match your benchmarking needs.

### When to Choose SQL Platforms

Choose SQL platforms (DuckDB, BigQuery, Snowflake, etc.) when:

- **You're benchmarking database systems** - Comparing cloud data warehouses or analytical databases
- **Your production workloads use SQL** - Testing the same queries your applications execute
- **You need distributed execution** - Cloud platforms automatically scale compute
- **Your team thinks in SQL** - Familiar with SQL query patterns and optimization

```bash
# SQL platforms execute queries as SQL strings
benchbox run --platform duckdb --benchmark tpch --scale 1
benchbox run --platform snowflake --benchmark tpch --scale 100
```

### When to Choose DataFrame Platforms

Choose DataFrame platforms (Polars-df, Pandas-df, PySpark-df, etc.) when:

- **You're benchmarking DataFrame libraries** - Comparing Polars vs Pandas vs PySpark
- **Your production code uses DataFrame APIs** - Data science workflows, ML pipelines
- **You want to compare paradigms** - SQL vs native DataFrame performance
- **You need lazy evaluation control** - Fine-grained control over execution plans

```bash
# DataFrame platforms execute using native APIs
benchbox run --platform polars-df --benchmark tpch --scale 1
benchbox run --platform pandas-df --benchmark tpch --scale 1
```

### Side-by-Side Comparison

| Aspect | SQL Platforms | DataFrame Platforms |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Query Format** | SQL strings | Native API calls (method chaining) |
| **Execution** | Database engine | Library (in-process or distributed) |
| **Scale Limit** | Petabyte+ (cloud) | Varies: SF 10-100 (single-node), SF 1000+ (PySpark) |
| **Use Case** | Production analytics, data warehousing | Data science, ML pipelines, library evaluation |
| **Debugging** | EXPLAIN plans | Step-through execution, lazy plan inspection |
| **Type Safety** | Runtime (SQL parsing) | Some compile-time (IDE support) |

### DataFrame Platform Quick Reference

| Platform | CLI Name | Best For | Max Scale Factor |
|----------|----------|----------|------------------|
| **Polars** | `polars-df` | High-performance single-node analytics | SF 100 (lazy eval) |
| **Pandas** | `pandas-df` | Data science prototyping, compatibility | SF 10 (memory-bound) |
| **PySpark** | `pyspark-df` | Distributed processing, big data | SF 1000+ (cluster) |
| **DataFusion** | `datafusion-df` | Arrow-native workflows, Rust performance | SF 50+ |

## Platform Combination Strategies

### Development to Production Pipeline

```python
# Development: Fast, local, free
dev_adapter = DuckDBAdapter()

# Testing: Automated, reproducible
test_adapter = DuckDBAdapter(database_path="test.duckdb")

# Production: Scalable, managed
prod_adapter = SnowflakeAdapter(
    warehouse_size="LARGE",
    database="PRODUCTION"
)

# Use same benchmark code across all environments
benchmark = TPCH(scale_factor=0.1)  # Small for dev/test
prod_benchmark = TPCH(scale_factor=100)  # Large for prod
```

### Multi-Platform Validation

```python
# Validate results across platforms (alphabetical order)
platforms = [
    ("ClickHouse", ClickHouseAdapter(host="test-cluster")),
    ("DuckDB", DuckDBAdapter()),
    ("Snowflake", SnowflakeAdapter(warehouse_size="MEDIUM")),
]

benchmark = TPCH(scale_factor=1)
results = {}

for name, adapter in platforms:
    results[name] = adapter.run_benchmark(benchmark)
    print(f"{name}: {results[name].total_time:.2f}s")

# Compare query results for consistency
```

### Cost-Performance Optimization

```python
# Start with cost-effective option
adapter = DuckDBAdapter(memory_limit="16GB")
results = adapter.run_benchmark(benchmark)

if results.total_time > target_sla:
    # Upgrade to cloud platform
    adapter = SnowflakeAdapter(warehouse_size="LARGE")
    results = adapter.run_benchmark(benchmark)

# Monitor costs and performance over time
```

## Migration Strategies

### From SQLite to Production

```python
# Phase 1: Validate on SQLite (testing only)
sqlite_adapter = SQLiteAdapter()
small_benchmark = ReadPrimitivesBenchmark(scale_factor=0.001)
sqlite_results = sqlite_adapter.run_benchmark(small_benchmark)

# Phase 2: Scale testing with DuckDB
duckdb_adapter = DuckDBAdapter()
medium_benchmark = TPCH(scale_factor=1)
duckdb_results = duckdb_adapter.run_benchmark(medium_benchmark)

# Phase 3: Production deployment (choose your cloud platform)
prod_adapter = SnowflakeAdapter(warehouse_size="LARGE")
# Or: prod_adapter = BigQueryAdapter(project_id="production")
# Or: prod_adapter = RedshiftAdapter(cluster_identifier="prod-cluster")
prod_benchmark = TPCH(scale_factor=100)
prod_results = prod_adapter.run_benchmark(prod_benchmark)
```

### From DuckDB to Cloud

```python
# Development on DuckDB
dev_config = {"scale_factor": 0.1}
dev_adapter = DuckDBAdapter()

# Migration validation (use any cloud platform)
migration_config = {"scale_factor": 1}
cloud_adapter = DatabricksAdapter(
    cluster_size="medium",
    auto_terminate_minutes=30  # Cost protection
)

# Production deployment
prod_config = {"scale_factor": 100}
prod_adapter = DatabricksAdapter(
    cluster_size="large",
    runtime_engine="PHOTON"
)
```

## Common Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Wrong Platform Choices

1. **Using SQLite for large datasets**
   ```python
   # DON'T: SQLite with TPC-H SF=10
   adapter = SQLiteAdapter()
   benchmark = TPCH(scale_factor=10)  # Will be extremely slow
   ```

2. **Using expensive platforms for development**
   ```python
   # DON'T: Snowflake X-Large for development
   adapter = SnowflakeAdapter(warehouse_size="4X-LARGE")  # $$$
   benchmark = TPCH(scale_factor=0.01)  # Tiny dataset
   ```

3. **Ignoring cost controls**
   ```python
   # DON'T: No cost limits on pay-per-query platforms
   adapter = BigQueryAdapter()  # No maximum_bytes_billed
   # Risk: Unexpected large bills
   ```

### ✅ Better Alternatives

1. **Progressive scaling approach**
   ```python
   # Start small, scale up as needed
   if dataset_size < 1_000_000:
       adapter = DuckDBAdapter()
   elif dataset_size < 100_000_000:
       adapter = ClickHouseAdapter()
   else:
       adapter = BigQueryAdapter()
   ```

2. **Cost-aware cloud usage**
   ```python
   # Always set cost controls
   adapter = BigQueryAdapter(
       maximum_bytes_billed=5_000_000_000,  # 5GB limit
       job_priority="BATCH"  # Lower cost
   )
   ```

3. **Environment-specific configurations**
   ```python
   import os

   if os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT") == "development":
       adapter = DuckDBAdapter()
   elif os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT") == "testing":
       adapter = DuckDBAdapter(database_path="test.duckdb")
   else:  # production
       adapter = SnowflakeAdapter(warehouse_size="LARGE")
   ```

## Summary

Platform selection depends on your specific requirements. Common platform choices by use case:

### SQL Platforms
- **Initial setup**: DuckDB (included by default, no dependencies)
- **No-cost options**: ClickHouse (self-hosted), DuckDB, SQLite
- **In-process execution**: ClickHouse, DuckDB (columnar architecture, no network overhead)
- **Enterprise teams**: Cloud platforms with governance features
- **Cloud-native deployments**: BigQuery, Databricks, Redshift, Snowflake (managed services)
- **Self-hosted deployments**: ClickHouse, DuckDB (full control)

### DataFrame Platforms
- **Single-node analytics**: Polars-df (multi-threaded, lazy evaluation)
- **Data science prototyping**: Pandas-df (familiar API, ecosystem compatibility)
- **Distributed big data**: PySpark-df (cluster-scale processing)
- **Arrow-native workflows**: DataFusion-df (Rust-based, Arrow integration)
- **GPU acceleration**: cuDF-df (NVIDIA RAPIDS, coming soon)

DuckDB is included with BenchBox by default for SQL benchmarking. Polars is included for DataFrame benchmarking. Cloud platforms and additional DataFrame libraries can be added as requirements grow.
