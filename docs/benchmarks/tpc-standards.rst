Official industry standards for comparing databases.

About the Transaction Processing Performance Council
----------------------------------------------------

The **Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC)** is a non-profit organization founded in 1988 that defines database benchmarking standards and publishes independently verified performance results. TPC benchmarks are the gold standard for database performance comparison because they provide:

- **Standardized workloads** - Precisely defined queries, data schemas, and execution rules
- **Audited results** - Independent verification ensures published results are reproducible
- **Price/performance metrics** - Enables cost-effectiveness comparisons, not just raw speed
- **Full disclosure** - Complete system configurations must be published with results

Why TPC Benchmarks Matter
-------------------------

When evaluating databases, TPC benchmarks provide several critical advantages:

**Apples-to-apples comparison**
   Unlike vendor-provided benchmarks that may be optimized for specific systems, TPC benchmarks use identical workloads across all platforms. This makes cross-platform comparison meaningful.

**Real-world complexity**
   TPC benchmarks model actual business scenarios with realistic data distributions, query complexity, and concurrency requirements. They test systems under conditions similar to production workloads.

**Industry acceptance**
   TPC results are widely recognized by analysts, procurement teams, and engineers. Published TPC results carry credibility that proprietary benchmarks cannot match.

**Historical tracking**
   With decades of results, TPC benchmarks enable tracking of performance improvements over time and across hardware generations.

TPC Benchmarks in BenchBox
--------------------------

BenchBox implements three TPC benchmarks, each targeting different use cases:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 40 40

   * - Benchmark
     - Focus
     - Best For
   * - **TPC-H**
     - Decision support queries on business data
     - General OLAP performance, platform comparison
   * - **TPC-DS**
     - Complex analytics with modern SQL features
     - Advanced analytics, query optimizer testing
   * - **TPC-DI**
     - Data integration and ETL operations
     - ETL pipeline performance, data warehouse loading

Note on Compliance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BenchBox implements TPC benchmark *workloads* for development and evaluation purposes. Official TPC compliance requires independent auditing and full disclosure reports. Results from BenchBox should be labeled as "TPC-H-like" or "derived from TPC-H" rather than official TPC results unless properly audited.
