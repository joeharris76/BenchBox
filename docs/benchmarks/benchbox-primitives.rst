BenchBox Primitives
===================

.. tags:: reference, custom-benchmark

Fundamental database operation testing designed for deep performance investigation.

Why Primitives?
---------------

Standard benchmarks like TPC-H measure end-to-end query performance, but when a query runs slowly, they don't tell you *why*. Is it the join algorithm? Predicate pushdown? Aggregation strategy? Data loading? Primitive benchmarks isolate individual operations to answer these questions.

BenchBox Primitives were created to fill a gap in the benchmarking landscape:

- **TPC benchmarks** test complete queries but hide which operations are slow
- **Microbenchmarks** test operations but lack realistic data characteristics
- **Primitives** combine isolated operations with benchmark-scale data

This approach enables systematic performance investigation that pinpoints bottlenecks.

Design Philosophy
-----------------

BenchBox Primitives follow several design principles:

**Isolation**
   Each primitive tests one operation or a small family of related operations. A filter primitive tests filtering, not filtering-then-joining. This isolation makes performance differences attributable to specific capabilities.

**Realistic data**
   Primitives use TPC-derived data with realistic distributions, cardinalities, and correlations. Testing a filter on uniformly distributed random data tells you little about production performance.

**Coverage**
   The primitives cover the fundamental operations that compose all analytical queries: scans, filters, projections, aggregations, joins, sorts, and more. Understanding primitive performance predicts complex query performance.

**Platform agnostic**
   Primitives work across SQL and DataFrame platforms, enabling comparison between Pandas and PostgreSQL, or Polars and DuckDB. The same logical operation is tested regardless of API.

Use Cases for Primitives
------------------------

**Performance debugging**
   When a TPC-H query runs slower than expected, run the corresponding primitives to identify which operation is the bottleneck. Is Q9's slowdown from the join strategy or the aggregation?

**Platform evaluation**
   Before choosing a database, test the operations your workload uses most. If your queries are join-heavy, the join primitives predict real performance better than aggregate TPC scores.

**Optimization validation**
   After tuning a database, run primitives to verify the optimization worked. Did the new index actually speed up the filter operation? Primitives provide focused measurement.

**Regression detection**
   Track primitive performance across database versions to catch regressions early. A 20% slowdown in aggregation primitives predicts problems before they appear in complex queries.

**DataFrame vs SQL comparison**
   Primitives enable apples-to-apples comparison between DataFrame libraries (Polars, Pandas) and SQL databases (DuckDB, PostgreSQL) on the same logical operations.

Primitive Categories
--------------------

BenchBox Primitives are organized into three categories:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 35 40

   * - Category
     - Operations
     - Insights
   * - **Read Primitives**
     - Scans, filters, projections, aggregations, joins, sorts, window functions
     - Query execution performance, optimizer effectiveness
   * - **Write Primitives**
     - Inserts, bulk loads, updates, deletes, upserts
     - Data loading performance, transaction overhead
   * - **Transaction Primitives**
     - Isolation levels, concurrent access, conflict resolution
     - ACID compliance, concurrency characteristics

DataFrame Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read and Write Primitives include full DataFrame implementations supporting both expression-based platforms (Polars, PySpark, DataFusion) and pandas-compatible platforms (Pandas, Modin, Dask, cuDF). This enables direct comparison between SQL and DataFrame performance on identical operations.
