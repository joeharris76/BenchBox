BenchBox keeps everyday workflows concise. Use this page as the jumping-off point for the tasks you perform most often.

## Essentials

- [Getting started in 5 minutes](getting-started.md) — install the tool, profile your system, and execute a reproducible first run.
- [CLI quick reference](cli-quick-start.md) — most-used commands and flags for interactive and unattended runs.
- [Configuration handbook](configuration.md) — YAML layouts, environment overrides, and precedence rules.
- [Examples & automation snippets](examples.md) — copyable scripts for Python and shell automation.
- [Python API reference](../reference/api-reference.md) — when you need to orchestrate runs programmatically.

## Extended Topics

- [Dry-run previews](dry-run.md) — validate queries, seeds, and artifacts without executing them.
- [Data generation & compression](data-generation.md) — storage footprint guidance and compression toggles.
- [Intelligent guidance](intelligent-guidance.md) — how the CLI adapts recommendations to your hardware profile.
- [Platform selection guide](../platforms/platform-selection-guide.md) — compare adapter capabilities before running at scale.
- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) — fix common environment and dependency issues fast.

## Next Steps

1. Run `uv run benchbox profile` to capture a baseline system profile.
2. Pick a platform with `uv run benchbox platforms list` and enable it if required.
3. Execute a benchmark with `uv run benchbox run --platform duckdb --benchmark tpch --scale 0.01`.
4. Inspect results via `uv run benchbox results --limit 1` or export JSON for CI with `uv run benchbox export`.
