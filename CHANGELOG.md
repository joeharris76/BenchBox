# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-24

### Fixed

- **Critical: TPC-H/TPC-DS query templates missing from wheel distribution** - BenchBox installed
  from PyPI via wheel could not run TPC-H or TPC-DS benchmarks because query template files were
  stored outside the package tree and excluded from wheels. Templates are now bundled inside
  `benchbox/_binaries/*/templates/` with a resolution utility that checks the bundled location
  first and falls back to `_sources/` for development installs.
- **dsqgen path buffer overflow** - TPC-DS query generation could fail on systems with long temp
  directory paths (e.g., macOS `/var/folders/...`) due to dsqgen's internal 80-char path buffer.
  Fixed by using short symlinks in the temp directory.
- Python 3.10 compatibility for CLI, version utilities, and `tomllib` imports
- Windows CI test failures and cross-platform compatibility issues
- DuckDB version compatibility in tests
- MCP server: XSS prevention and strengthened path traversal checks

### Added

- MCP server: 7 new tools (`get_query_details`, `detect_regressions`, `get_performance_trends`,
  `aggregate_results`, `get_query_plan`, `export_results`, `export_summary`) and 2 prompts
- GitHub Actions PyPI publishing with trusted publishers
- Release automation: `--push`, `--auto-continue`, CI validation integration, bidirectional sync
- Platform adoption tiers (`recommended`, `supported`, `experimental`, `preview`) replacing
  boolean `recommended` field

### Changed

- Minimum Python version explicitly documented as 3.10
- MCP server refactored to use public API instead of CLI internals
- Benchmark metadata centralized into single registry
- Per-platform TPC-DS query template duplicates removed (530 files, ~4MB saved from wheel)
- MANIFEST.in expanded to include TPC patches, EULAs, and compilation infrastructure for
  sdist users who build from source

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-10 (Initial Release)

> **Alpha Software**: BenchBox is alpha software. APIs may change without notice, features may be incomplete, and production use is not recommended. See [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md) for full details.

### Overview

BenchBox v0.1.0 is the **initial public release** of the database benchmarking framework. BenchBox makes it simple to run industry-standard benchmarks (TPC-H, TPC-DS) on analytical databases, from embedded engines like DuckDB to cloud data warehouses like Snowflake and Databricks.

### What's Included

**Benchmarks** (18 total):
- **TPC Standards**: TPC-H (22 queries), TPC-DS (99 queries), TPC-DI
- **Academic**: SSB, AMPLab, JoinOrder (IMDB dataset)
- **Industry**: ClickBench, H2ODB, NYC Taxi, TSBS DevOps, CoffeeShop
- **Data Modeling**: TPC-H Data Vault
- **BenchBox Primitives**: Read Primitives, Write Primitives, Transaction Primitives
- **Experimental**: TPC-DS-OBT, TPC-Havoc, TPC-H Skew

**SQL Platforms** (16 total):
- **Embedded**: DuckDB, SQLite, DataFusion
- **Cloud Data Warehouses**: Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, Redshift, Azure Synapse
- **Analytical Databases**: ClickHouse, Trino, Presto, Firebolt, InfluxDB
- **General Purpose**: PostgreSQL, Spark, Athena

**DataFrame Platforms** (8 total):
- **Expression Family**: Polars, DataFusion, DuckDB, PySpark
- **Pandas Family**: Pandas, Modin, Dask, cuDF (GPU)

**Core Features**:
- Self-contained data generation (no external tools required)
- Automatic SQL dialect translation between platforms
- CLI with dry-run support, progress bars, and rich output
- Programmatic Python API for integration
- Result export in JSON, CSV, and HTML formats

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install benchbox

# Run TPC-H on DuckDB
benchbox run --platform duckdb --benchmark tpch --scale 0.01

# Run with DataFrame API
benchbox run --platform polars-df --benchmark tpch --scale 0.01
```
